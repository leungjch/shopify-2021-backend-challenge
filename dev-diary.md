Here are my ideas for this project so far: Allow the user to upload multiple images to the backend. The backend runs an image classifier (something like YOLO V3) and generates keyword that tags the image. These images are stored somewhere, such as MongoDB or on Amazon S3. The user can use a search functionality to search by the AI-generated keywords. So if the user uploads an image of cake or horses and searches "horses", then they will filter by pictures of horses even though they (nor any other user) had manually described their image as a horse.
